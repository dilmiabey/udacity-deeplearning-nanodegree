# Udacity deeplearning nanodegree projects

## Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

In this project you get to build a nueral network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem based on the UCI machine learning database.


## Dog Breed classifier

In this project, you get to learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Here you use  CNNs built from scratch as
well from transfer learning to classify the dog breed.



## TV Script Generation

In this project, you get to generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.


## Generate Faces

In this project, you get to use GANs to generate new images of faces.
